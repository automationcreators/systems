# Creator Style Mimic

Analyze and replicate the unique writing styles of successful creators based on proven patterns from your Airtable data. This skill helps you understand what makes different voices work and apply those patterns to your own content.

## Overview

Creator style isn't random—it's a set of identifiable patterns:
- **Vocabulary choices** (simple vs. technical, casual vs. formal)
- **Sentence structure** (short punchy vs. long flowing)
- **Hook preferences** (contrarian vs. educational vs. storytelling)
- **Punctuation style** (em dashes, parentheticals, questions)
- **Emoji usage** (minimal vs. liberal, which types)
- **Content structure** (listicles vs. narratives vs. frameworks)

This skill extracts these patterns from successful creators and applies them to your content.

## Available Creator Profiles

Based on your Airtable data and framework analysis:
