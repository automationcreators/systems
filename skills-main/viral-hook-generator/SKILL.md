# Viral Hook Generator

Transform content ideas into viral hooks using proven engagement formulas. This skill applies systematic hook patterns that have generated millions of views across social media platforms.

## Overview

Viral hooks follow predictable patterns that:
- Challenge assumptions (contrarian)
- Promise clear value (benefit-driven)
- Show dramatic improvement (transformation)
- Offer step-by-step guidance (how-to)

Each hook type uses specific power words and structures to maximize engagement within the first 3 seconds.

## Hook Types

### Contrarian Snapback

Challenge common assumptions with a better approach. Perfect for technical content where conventional wisdom is wrong.

**Power Words:** why, most, instead, actually, wrong, misconception

**When to Use:**
- Debunking common practices
- Revealing hidden problems
- Challenging industry standards
- Introducing counterintuitive solutions

**Pattern Examples:**
- "Why {controversial_take} for {project}"
- "Most developers {common_mistake}. I {better_approach}"
- "Why {practice} is actually {reframe}"

**Real Example:**
- Title: "Why I build agents instead of scripts for Personal-OS"
- Description: "Scripts break. Agents adapt. Here's my autonomous agent pattern"

### Benefit-Driven

Lead with clear value proposition and measurable outcome. Best for educational content.

**Power Words:** how, unlock, boost, 10x, transform, maximize

**When to Use:**
- Teaching specific techniques
- Demonstrating productivity gains
- Showing measurable improvements
- Explaining complex systems simply

**Pattern Examples:**
- "How I {action} to {outcome} {project}"
- "How I structure {complex_thing} for {project}"

**Real Example:**
- Title: "How I use CLAUDE.md files to 10x Claude Code effectiveness"
- Description: "Updated 5 context files. Now Claude understands my codebase instantly"

### Transformation

Show dramatic before/after improvement. Ideal for case studies and success stories.

**Power Words:** transformed, breakthrough, saved, changed, revolutionized

**When to Use:**
- Sharing project milestones
- Demonstrating time savings
- Revealing workflow improvements
- Showcasing feature development

**Pattern Examples:**
- "The {project} breakthrough that saved me {time_saved}"
- "The {technique} that transformed {project}"

**Real Example:**
- Title: "The automation breakthrough that saved me 10 hours"
- Description: "Shipped 15 files in one sprint. Here's the Claude Code workflow"

### How-To

Educational step-by-step approach. Perfect for tutorials and guides.

**Power Words:** how, guide, step-by-step, here's, exactly

**When to Use:**
- Creating tutorials
- Explaining processes
- Sharing frameworks
- Teaching best practices

**Pattern Examples:**
- "I rebuilt {project} in {file_count} file changes (here's how)"
- "How to {action} (real example: {project})"
- "How I {action} with Claude Code ({result})"

**Real Example:**
- Title: "How I debug with Claude Code (no more console.log spam)"
- Description: "Prompt Claude to trace execution paths. Debugging made methodical"

## Application Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content Idea

Identify core elements:
- **Subject:** What is this about? (project, technique, tool)
- **Value:** What's the benefit or outcome?
- **Proof:** What metrics or results exist?
- **Context:** What category does this fit? (progress, learning, tips, architecture)

### Step 2: Select Hook Type

Match content to hook type based on:

| Content Category | Primary Hook Types | Secondary |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Progress Updates | Transformation, How-To | Contrarian |
| Learning Moments | Contrarian, How-To | Benefit-Driven |
| Tips & Tricks | Benefit-Driven, Transformation | Contrarian |
| Architecture Insights | Contrarian, How-To | — |

**Context Triggers:**
- **High file count (3+):** Use Transformation
- **Agent files present:** Use Contrarian Snapback
- **Testing/debugging focus:** Use How-To
- **Documentation updates:** Use Contrarian Snapback (reframe docs as prompts)
- **Workflow optimization:** Use Benefit-Driven

### Step 3: Fill Variables

Each hook template has specific variables. Extract from content idea:

**Common Variables:**
- `{project}` - Project name or domain
- `{file_count}` - Number of files changed
- `{time_saved}` - Hours/days saved
- `{technique}` - Specific method or approach
- `{common_mistake}` - What most people do wrong
- `{better_approach}` - Your alternative method
- `{outcome}` - Measurable result
- `{action}` - What you did

### Step 4: Generate Hook

Combine pattern + variables + description pattern:

**Formula:**
```
Hook Title = Pattern with filled variables
Hook Description = Description pattern with context
Technical Details = Specific metrics and methods
```

**Example Generation:**

Input:
- Category: progress_updates
- Project: Personal-OS
- Files changed: 12
- Context: Agent development

Hook Selection: Transformation (high file count trigger)

Output:
```
Title: "The Personal-OS breakthrough that saved me 10 hours"
Description: "Shipped 12 files in one sprint. Here's the Claude Code workflow that made it possible"
Technical Details: "12 Python files | Agent architecture | Event-driven patterns | Claude Code workflows"
```

### Step 5: Add Variety

Rotate through templates to avoid repetition. Use the same hook type but different patterns for similar content.

**Contrarian Snapback Rotation:**
1. "Why {controversial_take} for {project}"
2. "Most developers {common_mistake}. I {better_approach}"
3. "Why {practice} is actually {reframe}"

For the same "agent vs scripts" idea, rotate:
- Week 1: "Why I build agents instead of scripts"
- Week 2: "Most developers write scripts. I build autonomous agents"
- Week 3: "Why configuration files are actually agent blueprints"

## Platform-Specific Adjustments

### Twitter (280 chars)
- Use shortest pattern variation
- Include 2-3 hashtags
- Add category icon emoji

**Format:**
```
{icon} {hook_title}

{hook_description (max 120 chars)}

{hashtags}
```

### LinkedIn (3000 chars)
- Use longer description pattern
- Add personal story context
- Include technical details section
- Professional tone

**Format:**
```
{hook_title}

{hook_description}

Technical highlights:
• {detail_1}
• {detail_2}

Building in public with #ClaudeCode

{hashtags}
```

### Threads/Instagram
- Conversational tone
- More emojis allowed
- Hook + description + call-to-action

**Format:**
```
{icon} Just discovered something cool:

{hook_title}

{hook_description}

{hashtags}
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a hook:

- [ ] Uses power words from selected hook type
- [ ] Fills all required variables with specific values (no placeholders)
- [ ] Creates curiosity gap (doesn't reveal everything)
- [ ] Includes measurable outcome or specific example
- [ ] Matches content category context triggers
- [ ] Avoids repetition (check recent hooks in same category)
- [ ] Fits platform character limits
- [ ] Includes relevant hashtags

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

❌ **Vague hooks:** "How I improved my project"
✅ **Specific hooks:** "How I rebuilt authentication in 3 file changes"

❌ **Missing metrics:** "The technique that saved me time"
✅ **Measurable outcomes:** "The technique that saved me 10 hours"

❌ **Generic statements:** "Why you should use agents"
✅ **Contrarian framing:** "Why I build agents instead of scripts"

❌ **Overused words:** "game-changer," "revolutionary" (without proof)
✅ **Specific actions:** "saved 10 hours," "shipped 15 files"

## Integration with Content Workflow

This skill works best when:
1. Content ideas come from daily project analysis
2. Variables are auto-extracted from project metadata
3. Hook variety is enforced (no duplicates in 7-day window)
4. Performance tracking informs hook selection over time

**Recommended Stack:**
- Content idea generation → Social Media Content Agent
- Hook application → This skill (viral-hook-generator)
- Platform formatting → platform-voice-adapter skill
- Publishing → Manual or automation workflow
