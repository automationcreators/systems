- [ ] Tool Review (evaluating a specific tool)
- [ ] Transformation Story (before → after)
- [ ] Monetization (income, automation, passive)
- [ ] Learning/Tips (educational, frameworks)
- [ ] Contrarian Take (challenging assumptions)

**Complexity Level:**
- [ ] Quick Win (under 30 min to implement)
- [ ] Medium Project (1-4 hours)
- [ ] Complex Build (multi-day)

**Proof/Metrics Available:**
- [ ] Time saved (X hours → Y hours)
- [ ] Revenue ($X/month)
- [ ] Quantity (N files, X lines, Y systems)
- [ ] Performance (X% faster, Y% reduction)

### Step 2: Select Pattern by Content Type

| Content Type | Primary Pattern | Secondary Pattern |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Build Tutorial | Build a {Thing} With {Tool} With {Number} {Input} | From {Input} to {Output} in {Time} |
| Tool Review | {Tool} in Your {Context} is {Extreme_Adjective} | I Tested {Tool} for {Time} |

**Length Guidelines:**
- Optimal: 50-70 characters (full visibility in search)
- Maximum: 100 characters (before truncation)
- Front-load keywords (tool names first half)

### Step 5: A/B Test Variations

Generate 3-5 variations using different patterns:
